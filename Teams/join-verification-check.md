# Require verification checks to join Teams meetings and webinars in your org

**APPLIES TO:** ![Image of a checkmark for yes](media/circle-check.png) Meetings ![Image of a checkmark for yes](media/circle-check.png) Webinars ![Image of a x for no](media/x-for-no.png) Town halls

For a seamless experience, it's important to manage how anonymous participants join meetings and webinars in your org. Anonymous participants include users who join a Teams meeting without signing in, via the Teams web app, or through external meeting platforms.

If your organizers allow anonymous users to bypass the lobby, web bots might join and disrupt their meetings and webinars. As an admin, you can require human verification checks for anonymous users to join meetings in your org. Requiring a CAPTCHA challenge can prevent unwanted web-based bots from joining, recording, and causing disturbances in meetings and webinars.

## Manage verification checks for meetings and webinars in your org

You can use the Teams admin center or PowerShell manage verification checks for meetings and webinars in your org. You could also use a sensitivity label in Purview or a meeting template to require verification checks. To use meeting templates and sensitivity labels, you must have a Teams Premium license.

|Teams admins center policy value |PowerShell setting value | Behavior|
|---------|---------|---------------|
|Not required|NotRequired| **This is the default value**. When organizers with this policy create meetings and webinars, no users in that meeting complete a verification check before joining the meeting.|
|Anonymous users and people from untrusted organizations|AnonymousUsersAndUntrustedOrganizations| When organizers with this policy create meetings and webinars, anonymous users and people from untrusted organizations must complete a verification check before joining the meeting.  |

### Manage verification checks in the Teams admin center

1. Open the Teams admin center.
2. Expand **Meetings** from the navigation pane.
3. Under **Meetings**, select **Meeting Policies**.
4. Either select an existing policy or create a new one.
5. Navigate to the **Meeting join & lobby** section and select one of the following options for **Require a verification check from:**
   - Not required (default)
   - Anonymous users and people from untrusted organizations
6. Select **Save**

### Manage verification checks using PowerShell

To  manage how users in your org use Copilot for Teams meetings and events, use the **`-CaptchaVerificationForMeetingJoin`** parameter within the PowerShell [**CsTeamsMeetingPolicy**](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy) cmdlet.

Require anonymous users and users from untrusted organizations to complete a verification check before joining meetings and webinars created by organizers with this policy:

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -CaptchaVerificationForMeetingJoin AnonymousUsersAndUntrustedOrganizations
```

Prevent users from completing a verification check before joining meetings and webinars created by organizers with this policy:

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -CaptchaVerificationForMeetingJoin NotRequired
```
