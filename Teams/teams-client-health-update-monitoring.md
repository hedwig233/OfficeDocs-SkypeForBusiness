# Microsoft Teams update monitoring

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article describes a Microsoft Teams feature that hasn't yet been released. It's been announced, and it's coming soon. If you're an admin, you can find out when this feature will be released in the Message Center (in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home)). For more information, see [Teams client health](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=478610) and [Monitor Teams client updates](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=478609).

As an admin, it’s important that your users have the latest and the most secure version of the Teams client. Teams update monitoring in the Teams admin center allows you to proactively monitor Teams client updates and versions. It also helps identify users who aren't on latest version of Teams, so you can support them.

This dashboard highlights the client update status for the devices in your tenant and gives Microsoft recommended insights for moving users to the latest version of Teams client.

## Access the Teams update dashboard

To access the update monitoring and insights dashboard:

1. Go to the Teams admin center and login with your Admin credentials.
1. Select **Teams client health** from the navigation pane on the left-hand side of the window.

|Callout number |Details  |
|---------------|---------|
|Callout 1      |The Client update widget displays the overall version status distribution for all devices in your tenant. The update status widget provides statuses by three categories:</br>- Latest Build: A device is running a Teams client build newer than the last 100% released build.</br>- One or more builds behind: A device is running a Teams client build less than 30 days old and older than the last stable build.</br>- Outdated: A device is running a Teams client build more than 30 days old. |
|Callout 2      |The table under the **Health tab** shows a more detailed breakdown of this information, such as:</br>- Client versions: The exact client version number.</br>- Release Date: The date this specific client version was fully released to the general ring.</br>- Version status: The Teams client version status.</br>- Platform: The platform for the client version.</br>- Devices on this version: The total devices in the tenant currently running this client version.</br>- Users on this version: The total number of users in the tenant currently running this client version.</br>- Percentage of total users: The percentage of total users in the tenant currently running the client version.</br>- Device Crashes: The total number of devices that experienced a client crash in the last 28 days.</br>- Device launch failures: The total number of devices that experienced a client launch failure in the last 28 days. |

### Client version details

You can see your organization's client version distribution and adoption of each client version and the health of each client version in your organization. To view a detailed dashboard with insights, select any version from the health table from a row in this table.

You can identify users and devices running outdated version of Teams, and review troubleshooting insights on issues preventing users from updating to a newer version of Teams.
