# Manage meeting chat for Microsoft Teams town halls

**APPLIES TO:** ![Image of a x for no](/office/media/icons/cancel-teams.png)Meetings ![Image of a x for no](/office/media/icons/cancel-teams.png)Webinars ![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png) Town halls

[!INCLUDE[Teams Premium](includes/teams-premium-ecm.md)]

In Microsoft Teams town halls, only presenters, organizers, and co-organizers can use chat to communicate with each other. If town hall organizers have a Teams Premium license, they can turn on **Meeting chat** in their **Meeting options** to allow attendees to a chat and interact with each other. Meeting chat is only available during the town hall. Organizers, presenters, and co-organizers can still chat separately in the **Event group chat**.

As an admin, you can manage whether town hall organizers with a Teams Premium license can turn on meeting chat for their attendees.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature isn't supported for town halls with more than 20,000 attendees.

For details on how your users use meeting chat for town halls, see [Chat in a town hall in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/chat-in-a-town-hall-in-microsoft-teams-a4a0e102-ca45-4605-a0a8-83a884547338).

## Manage meeting chat for your organizers

To manage whether town hall organizers with a Teams Premium license can turn on meeting chat for their attendees, use the **`-TownhallChatExperience`** parameter within the PowerShell [**CsTeamsEventsPolicy**](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamseventspolicy) cmdlet.

The following table shows the behaviors of the settings for the **`-TownhallChatExperience`** parameter:

|Setting value| Behavior|
|---------|---------------|
|Optimized| **This is the default value.** Town hall organizers with this policy can turn on meeting chat for their attendees. |
|None| Town hall organizers with this policy can't turn on meeting chat for their attendees.|

### Turn off meeting chat

To turn off meeting chat, use the following script:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsEventsPolicy -Identity <policy name> -TownhallChatExperience None
```

### Turn on meeting chat

To turn on meeting chat, use the following script:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsEventsPolicy -Identity <policy name> -TownhallChatExperience Optimized
```

## Event chat eDiscovery and storage

Messages for meeting chat in town halls are only stored in the organizer's mailbox for up to 30 days. During this time, if you do a content search for the organizer, you can see all the messages that were sent in that meeting chat.
However, if you place the organizer’s mailbox on legal hold, the mailbox continues to keep the meeting chat messages for longer.

When the organizer leaves the company anytime from when the event is scheduled to 30 days after the town hall ends, the following details apply:

- Event chat might be unavailable during the town hall.
- Chat might be available during the event, but might not get sent to the organizer’s mailbox.
- Some messages aren't e-Discoverable in the organizer’s mailbox depending on when the organizer leaves the company.

If a town hall organizer leaves the company, you should reschedule the town hall.

You can't see which users viewed specific messages during the event. You also can't search for meeting chat messages in an attendee's mailbox.

Learn more, see [Get started with Content search](/purview/ediscovery-content-search).
