# Manage chat in Microsoft Teams meetings

**APPLIES TO:** ![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png) Meetings ![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png) Webinars ![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png) Town halls

## Overview

In Microsoft Teams, chat allows participants to exchange messages to each other before, during, and after meetings and webinars. For town halls, only presenters, organizers, and co-organizers can use chat with each other. To learn how attendees can use chat during town halls, see [Manage event chat for Microsoft Teams town halls](town-hall-chat.md).

As an admin you can control:

- Whether participants in your users' meetings and webinars can read and send chat messages.
- Whether users in your organization can use chat when they're participants in Teams meetings hosted by other organizations where there isn’t a trusted relationship.

## Manage chat messages for your organization's Teams meetings

The **Meeting chat** setting controls whether participants in your users' meetings can and read and send chat messages. This setting doesn't apply to channel meetings and is a per-user and per-organizer policy.

In addition to this **Meeting chat** policy, your users have their own **Meeting chat** control in their meeting options. When you don't set the admin policy to **Off**, organizers can manage chat availability in their meetings and webinars. They can choose to set chat to **On**, **Off**, or **In meeting only**. For more information on your users' **Meeting chat** controls, see [Chat in a Teams meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/64e2cb91-8a11-4781-94ea-fbb23f2b922f).

> [!NOTE]
> The admin policy doesn't control what organizers see in their **Meeting options**. For example, when you set the **Meeting chat** policy to **In-meeting only for everyone**, the organizer still sees the option to set it to **On**. However, the admin policy enforces that chat will only be available during the meeting. Your policy determines the chat experience during meetings and events, regardless of what's shown and selected in **Meeting options**.

The following table describes the behavior for your **Meeting chat** policy settings:

|Teams admin center value  |PowerShell value|Behavior |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**On for everyone**  | Enabled| All participants can read and send chat messages, but the organizer's **Allow meeting chat settings** determine the chat experience. Organizers can also control when chat is available during their meetings and webinars.|
|**On for everyone but anonymous users**  | EnabledExceptAnonymous|All participants, except anonymous ones, can read and send chat messages. The organizer's **Allow meeting chat** settings control the chat experience for everyone. Anonymous participants, however, can't read or send any messages. Organizers can also manage when chat is available during their meetings and webinars.|
|**Off**  | Disabled| Meeting chat is turned off for all participants; organizers can't use their **Allow meeting chat** to turn on chat in their meetings. Organizers can't override this setting.|
|**In-meeting only for everyone**  | EnabledInMeetingOnlyForAll| Chat is available only during the meeting. Participants and organizers can't send messages before the meeting starts or after it ends. Organizers can't override this setting.|
|**In-meeting only for everyone but anonymous users**  | EnabledInMeetingOnlyForAllExceptAnonymous| Chat is available only during the meeting for all participants, except anonymous users, who don't have any access to the chat. Participants and organizers can't send messages before the meeting starts or after it ends. Organizers can't override this setting.|

### Manage meeting chat for your organization's Teams meetings using the Teams admin center

To manage meeting chat for your users in the Teams admin center, use the following steps:

1. In the Teams admin center, expand **Meetings** and select **Meeting policies**.
1. Select the policy you'd like to edit.
1. Navigate to the **Meeting engagement** section.
1. Set **Meeting chat** to your chosen value of either **On for everyone**, **On for everyone but anonymous users**, **Off**, **In-meeting only for everyone**, or **In-meeting only for everyone but anonymous users**.
1. Select **Save**.

### Manage meeting chat using PowerShell

You can use the **`-MeetingChatEnabledType`** parameter in the[Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy) cmdlet to control the availability of meeting chat.

To allow meeting chat to be on for everyone but anonymous users with this assigned policy, run the following script:

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -MeetingChatEnabledType EnabledExceptAnonymous
```

To turn off meeting chat for users with this assigned policy, run the following script:

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -MeetingChatEnabledType Disabled
```

To make chat available only during meetings organized by users with this policy, run the following script:

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -MeetingChatEnabledType EnabledInMeetingOnlyForAll
```

To make chat available only during meetings organized by users with this policy and prevent anonymous users from seeing or writing in chat, run the following script:

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -MeetingChatEnabledType EnabledInMeetingOnlyForAllExceptAnonymous
```

To learn more about chat for your end users, see [Chat in a Teams meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/64e2cb91-8a11-4781-94ea-fbb23f2b922f).

## Manage chat messages in Teams meetings hosted by other organizations that you don’t have a trusted relationship with

The **Chat in external meetings** setting determines if users in your organization can chat in Teams meetings hosted by other organizations without a trusted relationship configured in [external access](trusted-organizations-external-meetings-chat.md). In such cases, the other organization considers your users to be anonymous. This setting is a per-user and per-participant policy.

The following table describes the behavior for your **Chat in external meetings** policy settings:

|Teams admin center value | PowerShell value| Behavior |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**On** | True|**This is the default value.** Users in your organization can read and send meeting chat messages in Teams meetings hosted by other organizations that you don't have a trusted relationship with. You must also set [**Meeting chat**](#manage-chat-messages-for-your-organizations-teams-meetings) to **On for everyone** and the meeting organizer must set [**Allow meeting chat**](https://support.microsoft.com/office/participant-settings-for-a-teams-meeting-53261366-dbd5-45f9-aae9-a70e6354f88e) to either **Enabled** or **In meeting only**. |
|**Off** | False|Users in your organization can't read or send meeting chat messages in Teams meetings hosted by other organizations that you don’t have a trusted relationship with. |

You can use the Teams admin center or PowerShell to manage whether users in your organization can use chat messages in Teams meetings hosted by other organizations without a trusted relationship.

### Manage chat in meetings hosted by other organizations using the Teams admin center

If you'd like to choose whether users in your organization can use chat in Teams meetings hosted by other organizations, follow these steps:

1. In the Teams admin center, expand **Meetings**, and select **Meeting policies**.
2. Select the policy you'd like to edit, or create a new one.
3. Navigate to the **Meeting engagement** section.
4. Toggle **External meeting chat** to **On** or **Off**.
5. Select **Save**.

### Manage chat in meetings hosted by other organizations using PowerShell

The **`-AllowExternalNonTrustedMeetingChat`** parameter in the [Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy) cmdlet controls the availability of meeting chat for your users when they attend external meetings. 

To turn off chat in Teams meetings hosted by other organizations for users with the assigned policy, run the following script:

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -AllowExternalNonTrustedMeetingChat $False
```

To allow chat in Teams meetings hosted by other organizations for users with the assigned policy, run the following script:

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -AllowExternalNonTrustedMeetingChat $True 
```

## Limitations

- Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows with a Pro license can't use chat when they join meetings as a presenter.
