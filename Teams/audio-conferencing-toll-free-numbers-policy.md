# Audio Conferencing policy settings for toll and toll-free numbers

## Teams Audio Conferencing policy

As an admin, you can use Audio Conferencing policies to manage the Audio Conferencing toll and toll-free numbers in your users' meeting invites. You can use one of the two automatically created policies or create and assign custom policies. The two automatically created policies are global (Org-wide default) and **`-AllowTollFreeDialInFalse`** (assigned to all existing users within the organization that aren't enabled for toll-free dial-in numbers). You manage Audio Conferencing policies in the Microsoft Teams admin center or by using [PowerShell](teams-powershell-overview.md).

You can't change the Global policy in the Teams admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> Custom Audio Conferencing policies aren't supported for Skype for Business Regionally Hosted Meetings. If you're using Regionally Hosted Meetings, you can manage the Audio Conferencing settings for your users in the Teams Admin Center by navigating to **Users** -> **Manage Users** -> **Select User** -> **Account**.

When a Teams Audio Conferencing policy is set up, two policies are automatically created. These policies and their default settings are:

### Global (Org-wide default)

In this policy, the value for **`-AllowTollFreeDialIn`** is set to **On** and there aren't any phone numbers defined in the policy. This is the default policy for all users in your organization who have **`-AllowTollFreeDialIn`** set to **On**.
The policy doesn't have any phone numbers defined, so when users with this policy create a Teams meeting, the available phone numbers remain unchanged from their prior settings. These phone numbers normally default to the user’s country/region, unless changed you change them for individual users.

For example, if a user in Germany already has German toll and toll-free numbers assigned before you create an Audio-conferencing policy, they keep these numbers after the policy is applied. Users don't notice any changes when you create the policy. However, if you update the Global Policy to include new phone numbers, all users with the assigned policy see these new numbers in their scheduled meetings.

> [!NOTE]
> If instead of updating the Global policy, you create a custom policy and applies it to some users, users see the settings defined in the custom policy in their meeting invites.

For example, if a custom policy with **`-AllowTollFreeDialInFalse`** has no defined phone numbers, users under this policy don't have toll-free numbers. Meeting invites that these users with this policy create have the same toll numbers as before the policy.
These phone numbers normally default to the user's country/region, unless you make changes for individual users.

### AllowTollFreeDialInFalse

In this policy, the value for **`-AllowTollFreeDialIn`** is set to **Off** and there aren't any phone numbers defined in the policy. This is the default policy for all users in your organization who, at the time of launch, have **`-AllowTollFreeDialIn`** set to **Off**.

Because the policy doesn't have any phone numbers defined, when users under this policy create a Teams meeting, the available phone numbers don't change. These phone numbers normally default to the user’s country/region, or location, unless you make changes for individual users.

If a user in Germany already has a German toll phone number before you create an Audio Conferencing policy, they keep this number under the **`-AllowTollFreeDialInFalse`** policy. Users don't notice any changes when you create the policy. However, if you update the **`-AllowTollFreeDialInFalse`** policy to include specific numbers, all policy users only see those numbers in their scheduled meetings."

## Create a custom audio-conferencing policy

An overview of the steps:

1. Navigate to the Microsoft Teams admin center and  go to **Meetings** > **Audio Conferencing**.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Enter the name and description of the policy. The name can't contain special characters or be longer than 64 characters.
1. Choose the settings that you want.
1. Select **Save**.

For example, you might have a group of users who regularly have meetings with participants from more than one country/region. In our example, the participants are from Canada, Botswana, and Singapore and they all want to join the meeting via Audio Conferencing by dialing a phone number. You can create a new custom policy named "Canada Botswana Singapore" and select phone numbers from these three countries/regions to be included in the policy through the **Add a phone number** option, and save this policy. You can then assign this policy to the required users.

This ensures phone numbers that you selected for Canada, Botswana, and Singapore are included in the meetings invites created by users of this policy.

### Step by step instructions on creating a custom policy based on the example

1. In Microsoft Teams admin center's navigation pane, go to **Meetings** > **Audio Conferencing**.
2. Select **Add**.
3. Enter the name and description of the policy. The name can't contain special characters or be longer than 64 characters.
4. Choose whether or not to include toll-free numbers in meetings created by users of this policy. Setting this to **On** lets you add toll-free phone numbers in this policy.
5. Select **Add a phone number**.
6. A pane opens on the screen with the **Search by location** box.
7. Enter Canada, and select a telephone number from Canada from the results.
8. Select **Add**.
9. Repeat steps 6 and 7 in the same way to search and add telephone numbers from Botswana and Singapore.
10. Select toll-free numbers if you turned on the setting to **Include toll-free numbers in meetings created by users of this policy** in step 4.
11. Select **Add** on the bottom right-hand corner of the pane. The telephone numbers from the three countries/regions that you selected are listed.
12. There's a rank column that determines the order in which the telephone numbers are displayed in meetings invites created by users of this policy. You can change the order by selecting a phone number and moving it up or down using the **Move up** and **Move down** buttons respectively.
13. Once you put the phone numbers in the order of your preference, select **Save**.
14. Your custom policy named 'Canada Botswana Singapore' is created.
15. After creation is complete, you can assign this policy to your users.

## Update a meeting policy

You can update any custom policies that you create, but you can't update the Global policy from the Teams admin center.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Meetings** > **Audio Conferencing**.
1. Choose the policy you want to update by selecting to the left of the policy name, and then selecting **Edit**.
1. Make your updates.
1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't delete a policy that has users assigned to it. Once you assign a different policy to all affected users, you can delete the original policy.

## Assign a meeting policy to users

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once a new Audio-conferencing policy is applied to a user, the phone numbers defined in the policy in only available in new meetings this user organizes. Any existing and recurring meetings scheduled before the policy continue to show the existing settings, for example one toll and one toll-free number (if toll-free was enabled for that user). A scenario here could be that a user had **Allow Toll-Free** turned on and had a toll-free number assigned, and they created recurring meetings for future. In this scenario, if you create a custom policy with **-AllowTollfreeDialIn** turned **Off** and apply it to this user, any new meetings this user organizes don't include toll-free numbers, but the existing and recurring meetings still show toll-free numbers. When callers dial this toll-free number to join the meeting, the call fails because toll-free is now turned off for this user due to the policy. To prevent this, you can migrate users' existing meetings after assigning them the new audio-conferencing policy. To learn more, see [Using the Meeting Migration Service (MMS)](/SkypeForBusiness/audio-conferencing-in-office-365/setting-up-the-meeting-migration-service-mms).

You can assign a policy directly to users or to a group that the users are members of (if supported for the policy type), either individually or in larger numbers through a batch assignment (if supported for the policy type). To learn about the different ways that you can assign policies to users, see [Assign policies to users and groups](assign-policies-users-and-groups.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign a user one Audio Conferencing policy at a time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It can take up to 24 hours for the assigned phone numbers to show up on your meeting invite. If you aren't seeing updated numbers appear, wait at least 24 hours before contacting support.

### Known issues

When you start a meeting using the **Meet now** option from **Microsoft Teams** > **Calendar** > **Meet Now**, if you then select the ellipsis menu option, and then **Meeting Info**, there's an issue with the lower portion of the section under **Or call in (audio only)**. All phone numbers defined in the policy are shown, but the alignment of the numbers makes it difficult to read.
